[Edwin Watkeys](https://github.com/edw) has just released a
[profiling extension for CIDER](https://github.com/thunknyc/nrepl-profile),
based on his library
[profile](http://github.com/thunknyc/profile). The profiling data you'll get
is rather crude, but it's still better than nothing and is certainly nicer
than what you'd get by using `time`. 

Here you can see the extension in action:
