<div class="entry-content"><h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>I guess nothing describes more appropriately the essence of career
development than the famous song by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Gn0e7kvTA">The Clash</a>.</p>

<p>We generally have two options in front of us when we consider our
careers &ndash; stay at our current company and hope to advance in it or
jump ship to a new hopefully better job in another company. Both have
their pros and cons which I&rsquo;ll shortly discuss. Mind, though, that I&rsquo;m
no HR specialist or a pro career adviser so you&rsquo;d do well not to rely
on my writing a 100%. Also everything I&rsquo;ll write comes from my own
experience as professional software engineer. I guess some of my
advice will not apply to other careers.</p>

<h2>Stay at my current company</h2>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> &ndash; <em>there are some
companies that are so great that no one wants to leave them. This
section is not about them. This is about the companies we all know and
have grown accustomed to tolerate &ndash; the ones with the mostly same
work, lying bosses and a lot of empty promises.</em></p>

<p>The idea is basic. You&rsquo;ve spent some time in the company, you&rsquo;re
hoping that in time with hard work and dedication you&rsquo;ll rise in the
company ranks and you&rsquo;ll get a healthy salary increase in the process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn&rsquo;t happen quite often. Most companies have
some internal salary limits and some next to irreplaceable
people. This means that there is a cap at your growth there. Sure, if
you stay with the company long enough &ndash; say 10 years, probably some of
the irreplaceable people will be replaced, but is worth the wait?</p>

<p>When you sit around just doing the same things you tend to get bored
and demotivated at times. You become less productive and less
interested in your work in general. You just go to work, stay there
for 8 hours and go home. The paycheck is the only thing of interest
to you and you become duller and duller by the day.</p>

<p>This is what I call &ldquo;flowing down the current&rdquo;. One of my former bosses used
to say that when you start feeling you&rsquo;re flowing down the current you
should immediately start looking for another job(that is unless you&rsquo;re
one of the those people that just like to complain how they hate their
job, but actually doesn&rsquo;t mind to sit around doing nothing and get
paid for it). My boss also used to say that one shouldn&rsquo;t spend more
than 3 or 4 years in a company he doesn&rsquo;t own.</p>

<p>Of course you shouldn&rsquo;t jump between jobs every 6 or so months because
this will make you a blacklisted candidate by most HRs &ndash; after all
they&rsquo;re looking most of the time for people ready to commit to their
cause for at least a few years.</p>

<p>Pros of staying:</p>

<ul>
<li>you know the game and how to play it</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re accustomed to colleagues, the office and you don&rsquo;t have to
change them</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ve got a guaranteed paycheck that is unlikely to evaporate</li>
<li>if the company is bigger(100+) you&rsquo;ve got a fair chance to advance
in the company hierarchy if you&rsquo;re willing to stay long enough</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons of staying:</p>

<ul>
<li>you limit your professional development</li>
<li>you limit the possibilities for salary improvements</li>
</ul>


<p>In the end it seems to me that most people are not too fond of taking
chances(me included). This is the reason that a lot of average
companies have employees that could do a lot better somewhere
else. This is partly caused by our very own society &ndash; the people and
media around us keep telling us that we&rsquo;re mostly the same, that it&rsquo;s
unlikely we&rsquo;ll ever achieve something great, something
monumental&hellip; and many of us do believe them.</p>

<p>Hristo Stoichkov might not be the all time greatest philosopher, but
said something extremely important once(or twice) &ndash; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t play
you can&rsquo;t win&rdquo;(in Bulgarian &ndash; &ldquo;Който не играе не печели.&rdquo;).</p>

<h2>Move to another company</h2>

<p>Moving to another company is not a silver bullet. Most of the time it
guarantees you a higher salary(the top reason why people switch
jobs), but it doesn&rsquo;t certainly mean you&rsquo;ll have a more interesting
and fulfilling work. This is especially true if you go to work for
some huge corporation and you&rsquo;re not part of its Research&amp;Development
department. I generally avoid such job offers. Corporations offer some
measure of security, but little if any excitement.</p>

<p>I think that most people should try to find employment in companies
that are start-ups or that regularly start to work on new
projects. There one has plenty of opportunities to prove himself and
to advance in the company along the way. Of course such companies have
the nasty habit of going down under from time to time so you have to
think long and hard before joining one if you&rsquo;re living under rent or
have to pay down-payments on two mortgages. Of course if you&rsquo;re good
enough at your job &ndash; you&rsquo;ll find a new one soon enough and that shouldn&rsquo;t
really be bothering you.</p>

<p>Pros of moving:</p>

<ul>
<li>moving to a new company is likely to represent a raise in your
salary you&rsquo;ll have to wait several years to get with your current
employer</li>
<li>there is a strong possibility that your new work will be more
exciting than your old one(after all you&rsquo;ve tried to pick a more
exciting job, right?)</li>
<li>you might get to meet some interesting new people, learn from them
and improve your professional skills</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons of moving:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have to prove your worth again(you&rsquo;ve already did this in your
old job)</li>
<li>the is the factor of uncertainty every time you start something new</li>
<li>you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to work and deal with your new colleagues</li>
<li>you might get more of the same work that made you leave in the first
place in case you have not chosen carefully your new employer.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Topics such a career development are highly subjective and depend on a
myriad of factors. My musings here are inspired by my 7 year long
career as a software engineer that spanned over four employers and
will probably soon include a fifth. This is not a lot of data to
consider, but I can assure you that the traits that I describe are
most real and are here to stay.</p>
