    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good news, everyone &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> 0.14 was just released!</p>

<p>Generally I announce RuboCop releases in only <a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">140 characters</a>,
but this time I&rsquo;ll make an exception. This release is more significant
than most of our recent releases for one particular reason &ndash; we&rsquo;ve
made an effort to make more aspects of RuboCop configurable than ever
before. For instance now you can make RuboCop enforce the use of
double-quoted strings, hashes that only use hash rockets, no spaces
inside block parentheses and more of that sort.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started the project with the simple goal of creating a tool to help you follow the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby Style Guide</a> to the
letter &ndash; originally it didn&rsquo;t even have configuration options for that very reason :&ndash;)
The project, however, quickly outgrew its humble origin and became much more popular than I could have envisioned.
Today we have a core team of RuboCop hackers, dozens of contributors and thousands of users.
Having received a lot of feedback over the past year from people who use slightly
modified version of the style guide, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that the initial
approach was hardly optimal and now supporting various popular coding
practices is one of the core values of RuboCop.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve abstained from trying out RuboCop, because you don&rsquo;t agree
with portions of the style guide &ndash; now it&rsquo;s a good time to take it out
for a spin. A list of all changes in 0.14 can be found
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.
All configurable aspects of RuboCop are listed <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml">here</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. As usual &ndash; suggestions for new features and improvements are always welcome! We can make RuboCop only as good as you want it to be!</p>

    <updated>2013-07-01T17:06:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2013/07/01/rubocop-0-dot-9-is-now-patrolling-the-streets</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a> 0.9 is finally out! This
was one of our most ambitious releases &ndash; over a month of work, ~250
commits, lots of new cops and features and a lot less bugs (OK, I&rsquo;m
not sure about this, but I sincerely hope it&rsquo;s true). Here&rsquo;s the
highlights.</p>

<h2>Portable Linting</h2>

<p>This is a big deal! Prior to 0.9, RuboCop piggybacked on MRI&rsquo;s <code>ruby
-wc</code> to find syntax errors and lint warnings. Obviously apart from
being unportable &ndash; this wasn&rsquo;t particularly fast (spawning processes
never is) either.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s no longer the case &ndash; errors are now reported directly by
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">Parser</a> and we&rsquo;ve reimplemented
MRI&rsquo;s linting in pure Ruby into RuboCop itself. Now you&rsquo;ll get the
same errors and warnings on MRI, JRuby and Rubinius. And to top it
off &ndash; we&rsquo;ve added much nicer warning messages and we report even
column information for those (MRI doesn&rsquo;t). This brings me to the next
point.</p>

<h2>Column information</h2>

<p>All RuboCop diagnostics now feature column information as well. Now
you&rsquo;ll be able to jump to a problem in your code even faster. But that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</p>

<h2>Formatter Support</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve introduced the concept of formatters (similar the to RSpec
formatter concept) and we&rsquo;ve bundled a few formatters. We&rsquo;ve also
changed the default output format &ndash; it now pretty similar to <code>clang</code>&rsquo;s
and features extra context information:</p>

<p><code>``
spec/models/authentication_spec.rb:12:44: W:</code>&ndash;&lsquo; interpreted as argument prefix</p>

<pre><code>}.to change(Authentication, :count).by -1
                                       ^
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Pretty sure most of you will love this :&ndash;)</p>

<h2>Auto-correction Support</h2>

<p>Running <code>rubocop -a</code> will now correct certain problems automatically. This
feature is alpha quality and just a few cops have support for it right
now. It goes without saying that you shouldn&rsquo;t use it on projects not under
version control (who doesn&rsquo;t use version control?) and without
an excellent test suite (that you undoubtedly have).</p>

<h2>Rails Support</h2>

<p><code>rubocop -R</code> will run additional Rails specific code checks. This
feature is also alpha at this point (meaning there&rsquo;s just one Rails
specific check at this point).</p>

<h2>The Road to 1.0</h2>

<p>We plan 1.0 to be the next RuboCop major release. No new features are in
the pipeline for 1.0 &ndash; we already have so many features that require extra
work and polish anyways. If all goes well expect 1.0 by summer&rsquo;s end with:</p>

<ul>
<li>performance optimizations</li>
<li>refined formatters</li>
<li>enhanced auto-correction support</li>
<li>lots of Rails specific checks</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy RuboCop 0.9. For the gory details, please take a
