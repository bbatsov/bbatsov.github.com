    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most experienced Rubyists probably know that there are two ways to interpolate instance, class and global variables into
strings.</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>compact notation (works only for instance/class/global vars)</h1>

<p>&ldquo;this is #$some_var&rdquo;</p>

<h1>standard notation (works for any expression)</h1>

<p>&ldquo;this is #{$some_var}&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;ve noticed you can leave out the <code>{}</code> which can&rsquo;t be left out for any other expression. Some people find this
interpolation syntax concise and elegant, but I&rsquo;ll argue that it should be avoided. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can&rsquo;t use this notation in every possible scenario:</li>
</ul>


<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>this is fine</h1>

<p>puts &ldquo;#{@variable}string_straight_after_without_space&rdquo;</p>

<h1>but this means something totally different</h1>

<p>puts &ldquo;#@variablestring_straight_after_without_space&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>This means that using the compact notation only when applicable forces you to introduce some inconsistency in your code.
This is rarely good&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re using different notations for the same basic operation (interpolation), without getting anything in return.
That&rsquo;s not the same with semantic use of single and double quoted strings or <code>fail</code> and <code>raise</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>using compact</h1>

<p>&ldquo;this is #@x&rdquo;
&ldquo;this is #{x}&rdquo;</p>

<h1>using standard</h1>

<p>&ldquo;this is #{@x}&rdquo;
&ldquo;this is #{x}&rdquo;
```</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to make a mistake in the context of a regular expression
(as interpolation works in regexp literals).  Recently I saw the
following regexp &ndash; <code>/[0-9.(),;:!?%#$?\x27\x22_+=\\\/\-]*/</code>. There&rsquo;s a
subtle problem with it, that&rsquo;s not obvious (unless you have a good
editor, that is). The sequence <code>#$?</code> is interpreted as interpolation
of the global variable <code>$?</code> (a.k.a. <code>$CHILD_STATUS</code>) and this regexp doesn&rsquo;t work as intended.</li>
</ul>


<p>This scenario shows that the syntax was ill-conceived.</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-experience Rubyists probably don&rsquo;t know about the compact interpolation notation.
Few books and tutorials mention it these days, so using it your code will confuse at least
some of the people reading it.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>It seems to me that Ruby will be better off without a special syntax
for variable interpolation. Ideally it would be removed in Ruby 3 and
we&rsquo;ll have one less thing to worry about in our Ruby code.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for today, folks!</p>

    <link href="http://batsov.com/articles/2014/02/17/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-13-length-vs-size-vs-count/"/>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2014/02/17/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-13-length-vs-size-vs-count</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the problems newcomers to Ruby experience is that there are
often quite a few ways to do same thing. For instance &ndash; you can obtain
the number of items in <code>Enumerable</code> objects (instances of classes
using the <code>Enumerable</code> mixin, which would often be collections like
<code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>, <code>Set</code>, etc) by either using <code>Enumerable#count</code> or the
methods <code>length</code> and its alias <code>size</code> that such classes often
provide.</p>

<p>``` ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]</p>

<p>arr.length # => 3
arr.size # => 3
arr.count # => 3</p>

<p>h = { a: 1, b: 2 }</p>

<p>h.length # => 2
h.size # => 2
h.count # => 2</p>

<p>str = &lsquo;name&rsquo;
str.length # => 4
str.size # => 4</p>

<h1>str.count won&rsquo;t work as String does not include Enumerable</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Which one should you use? Let me help with this choice.</p>

<p><code>length</code> is a method that&rsquo;s not part of <code>Enumerable</code> &ndash; it&rsquo;s part of a
concrete class (like <code>String</code> or <code>Array</code>) and it&rsquo;s usually running in
<code>O(1)</code> (constant) time. That&rsquo;s as fast as it gets, which means that
using it is probably a good idea.</p>

<p>Whether you should use <code>length</code> or <code>size</code> is mostly a matter of
personal preference.  Personally I use <code>size</code> for collections (hashes,
arrays, etc) and <code>length</code> for strings, since for me objects like
hashes and stacks don&rsquo;t have a length, but a size (defined in terms of
the elements they contain). Conversely, it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to
assume that some text has some length. Anyways, in the end you&rsquo;re
invoking the same method, so the semantic distinction is not
important.</p>

<p><code>Enumerable#count</code>, on the other hand, is a totally different
beast. It&rsquo;s usually meant to be used with a block or an argument and
will return the number of matches in an <code>Enumerable</code>:</p>

<p>``` ruby
arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]</p>

<p>arr.count(&amp;:even?) # => 3
arr.count(1) # => 2
```</p>

<p>You can, however, invoke it without any arguments and it will return the size of the enumerable on which it was invoked:</p>

<p><code>ruby
arr.count # =&gt; 7
</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a performance implication with this, though &ndash; to calculate the
size of the enumerable the <code>count</code> method will traverse it, which is
not particularly fast (especially for huge collections). Some classes
(like <code>Array</code>) implement an optimized version of <code>count</code> in terms of
<code>length</code>, but many don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The takeaway for you is that you should
avoid using the <code>count</code> method if you can use <code>length</code> or <code>size</code>.</p>

<p>A note to Rails developers &ndash; <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code>&rsquo;s <code>length</code>,
<code>size</code> and <code>count</code> methods have a totally different meaning, but that&rsquo;s
irrelevant to our current discussion. (<code>Sean Griffin</code> has written

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, folks! As usual I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts here and on

    <link href="http://batsov.com/articles/2014/02/04/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-12-proc-vs-proc-dot-new/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-04T16:20:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2014/02/04/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-12-proc-vs-proc-dot-new</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are often confused about the fact that there are two ways to created <code>proc</code>s in Ruby &ndash;
via <code>Kernel#proc</code> and <code>Proc.new</code>. Let&rsquo;s see them in action:</p>

<p>``` ruby
Proc.new { true }</p>

<h1>=> #&lt;Proc:0x007fe35440a058></h1>

<p>proc { true }</p>

<h1>=> #&lt;Proc:0x007fe35440a059></h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Hmmm, it seems we get exactly the same results&hellip; While this is true
on Ruby 1.9+, this was not always the case.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.8, <code>Kernel#proc</code> is actually a synonym for <code>Kernel#lambda</code>
which was extremely confusing, since as we all know <code>lambda</code>s an
<code>proc</code>s differ in
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626/when-to-use-lambda-when-to-use-proc-new">subtle ways</a>. Luckily
sanity prevailed and Ruby 1.9 made <code>Kernel#proc</code> a synonym for
<code>Proc.new</code> instead.</p>

<p>At this point, however, people couldn&rsquo;t use <code>Kernel#proc</code> anymore if they
wanted to write code that&rsquo;s behaving in the same way on both Ruby 1.8
and Ruby 1.9 and the use of <code>Kernel#proc</code> was generally discouraged.
Thankfully Ruby 1.8 is now dead and buried and there&rsquo;s no reason to prefer
<code>Proc.new</code> over <code>Kernel#proc</code> anymore.  As a matter of fact &ndash; you
should probably be using only <code>Kernel#proc</code> as it&rsquo;s more concise and
it&rsquo;s symmetrical to <code>Kernel#lambda</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
lambda { true }</p>

<h1>=> #&lt;Proc:0x007fe35440a058 (lambda)></h1>

<p>proc { true }</p>

<h1>=> #&lt;Proc:0x007fe35440a059></h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>By the way, given <code>proc</code>&rsquo;s fairly counter-intuitive behavior regarding <code>return</code>, you should probably
use <code>lambda</code>s most of the time.</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2013/09/26/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-11-invoking-lambdas-slash-procs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are whopping 4 ways to invoke a lambda (or a proc) in Ruby:</p>

<p>``` ruby
lambda.call(arg1, arg2)</p>

<p>lambda[arg1, arg2]</p>

<p>lambda.(arg1, arg2)</p>

<h1>works only with one argument lambdas</h1>

<p>lambda === arg
```</p>

<p>The last option <code>Proc#===</code> is a special case, that&rsquo;s quite useful
in <a href="http://batsov.com/articles/2013/09/24/lambdas-slash-procs-in-case-expressions/">case expressions</a>,
but should never the used directly.</p>

<p>Of the three general purpose <code>Proc</code> methods that are available (it&rsquo;s
actually just one method with two aliases) I&rsquo;d strongly encourage you
to stick with<code>Proc#call</code>. The reasons are quite simple:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>lambda[arg]</code> looks like an index access on some data structure and you&rsquo;d certainly
have to analyze the code context to understand what&rsquo;s going on (especially since the <code>lambda</code> is unlikely to actually be named
<code>lambda</code> in actual code :&ndash;)).</p></li>
<li><p><code>lambda.(arg)</code> is a cute syntactic trick, but it&rsquo;s really easy to overlook the <code>.</code> and assume that this is a normal
method call (which probably was the point when this syntax was introduced). <code>lambda</code>s in Ruby are not real lambdas (they are instances of the <code>Proc</code> class) and we should simply embrace this fact instead of trying to hide it behind awkward syntax.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I value code clarity and readability immensely and I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of excessive usage of
operator overloading. The use of operators for lambda invocations in Ruby represents the ugly side of operator overloading &ndash;
instead of increasing the readability of the code, the operators actually decrease it.</p>

    <id>http://batsov.com/articles/2013/09/05/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-10-in-cryptic-perlisms-we-do-not-trust</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For better or for worse Perl had significant influence over Ruby&rsquo;s
initial design. A lot of things were directly borrowed from Perl, but
over the years the Ruby community rejected most of the Perlisms. In
this article I&rsquo;ll go over most of the Perl legacy which you should try
to steer clear from.</p>

<h3>Global variables</h3>

<p>Global variables are the nemesis of object-oriented programming(most
OO languages don&rsquo;t even have the concept of a global variable). Don&rsquo;t
introduce any of those in your Ruby programs! In most cases you can
substitute them for module instance variables:</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>bad</h1>

<p>$foo_bar = 1</p>

<h1>good</h1>

<p>module Foo
  class &lt;&lt; self</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :bar
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>Foo.bar = 1
```</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one cannot code Ruby and get away without using the built-in global
variables&hellip;</p>

<h3>Special global variables</h3>

<p>Originally Ruby borrowed just about all of Perl&rsquo;s special global
variables, known worldwide for their <strong>intention revealing names</strong> &ndash;
<code>$:</code>, <code>$;</code>, <code>$!</code>, <code>$$</code>, <code>$\</code>, etc. I&rsquo;ve coded Ruby for quite some time now and
still can&rsquo;t remember what half of those meant (and I knew a bit of
Perl before I knew any Ruby). Luckily at some point the
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/English/rdoc/English.html">English library</a>
was added to Ruby, which simply adds sensible aliases for the cryptic
Perl names. With it you can change this code:</p>

<p>``` ruby
$:.unshift File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>)</p>

<p>files = <code>git ls-files</code>.split($)
```</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>``` ruby
require &lsquo;English&rsquo;
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>)</p>

<p>files = <code>git ls-files</code>.split($INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR)
```</p>

<p>I think that the improvement is pretty obvious.  Why <code>English</code> is not required by
default is beyond me. Personally I use it always and I think you should do the same.</p>

<h3>Last regexp captures</h3>

<p>When you do a regexp match (like <code>/regexp/ ~= string</code>) a few special
global variables with funky names get populated with the prematch,
match, postmatch, etc. If the regexp has any groups in it, the stuff
they matched gets assigned to other special variables with the
descriptive names <code>$1</code> (for the first group), <code>$2</code> (for the second
group), etc. This idiom is unfortunately very popular with Ruby
developers, likely because few of them know of <code>Regexp.last_match</code>.</p>

<p>``` ruby
/(regexp)/ =~ string
&hellip;</p>

<h1>this is Perl-style</h1>

<p>process $1</p>

<h1>this is the same, but more clear and more object oriented</h1>

<p>process Regexp.last_match[1]
```</p>

<p>Basically you can extract from <code>Regexp.last_match</code> everything you&rsquo;d get from the special global variables.</p>

<p>Yep, you&rsquo;ll have to type more, but when clarity is at stake a little bit of extra typing is certainly justified.</p>

<p>You can even go a step further and use the <code>Regexp#match</code> method:</p>

<p>``` ruby
md = /(Bat.+)\s/.match(&lsquo;Batman rules!&rsquo;)</p>

<h1>=> #<MatchData "Batman " 1:"Batman"></h1>

<p>md[1]</p>

<h1>=> &ldquo;Batman&rdquo;</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>By the way, keep in mind that it&rsquo;s generally a good idea to use named
regexp groups over positional ones, once you&rsquo;re dealing with more than
two groups. Numbers simply don&rsquo;t convey that much meaning&hellip;</p>

<h3>BEGIN/END blocks</h3>

<p>Strictly speaking those came from <code>awk</code>, but I still consider them
part of the Perl legacy. If you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about feel
free to skip this section &ndash; your soul has already been saved.</p>

<p>``` ruby
END {
  puts &ldquo;Exiting&hellip;&rdquo;
}</p>

<p>puts &ldquo;Processing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>BEGIN {
  puts &ldquo;Starting&hellip;&rdquo;
}
```</p>

<p><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before everything else in your program in
the order in which they are encountered. <code>END</code> blocks are executed right before
the program exits. Those hideous constructs mess with the flow of
control of the program and are totally useless. I&rsquo;ve never ever needed
a <code>BEGIN</code> block and <code>END</code> blocks are totally replaceable with
<code>Kernel#at_exit</code>. I guess they might have some utility for old-school
scripting tasks, but application developers should ignore them
completely!</p>

<h3>Flip-flops</h3>

<p>Same as in the previous section &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about feel free to
skip this section &ndash; your soul has already been saved.</p>

<p>Flip-flops are an obscure conditional construct with just a single useful application &ndash; text processing:</p>

<p>``` ruby
DATA.each_line do |line|
  print line if (line =~ /begin/)..(line =~ /end/)
end</p>

<p><strong>END</strong>
0a
1begin
2c
3end
4e
5f
6begin
7end
8i
9j
```</p>

<p>This will print:</p>

<p><code>
1begin
2c
3end
6begin
7end
</code></p>

<p>Hopefully you&rsquo;ve managed to deduce how they work from this example, if
you haven&rsquo;t &ndash; you&rsquo;ve just understood what their main problem is.</p>

<p>I never had to use those and probably you won&rsquo;t have a reason to use them
either. Their usage is likely going to do just one thing for you &ndash; reduce the
readability of the code you&rsquo;re writing.</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d really love to see some of those Perlisms out of Ruby &ndash; the
removal of <code>flip-flops</code> and <code>BEGIN/END</code> gets suggested upstream every
now and then and might happen in Ruby 3.0. Removing the global
variables, however, is unlikely to ever happen since that would be a
huge change.</p>
