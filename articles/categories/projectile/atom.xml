    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> 0.12 is finally out!</p>

<p>A lot of time has passed since the previous stable release, for which
I&rsquo;m truly sorry.  I kept delaying and delaying the release for various
reasons, but it&rsquo;s finally here and it&rsquo;s pretty <strong>big</strong>.  Please,
consult the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>
for some of the more interesting changes. Note that some changes and
new features are totally undocumented, as I haven&rsquo;t been as demanding
to contributors as I&rsquo;m usually on my other projects (meaning I didn&rsquo;t
ask everyone to update the changelog or the readme).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how open-source works &ndash; I never expected that Projectile
would have any users except me, but today it&rsquo;s one of the most popular
3rd party Emacs extensions. Unfortunately I&rsquo;m involved with many
other projects and have a pretty demanding day job, so issues and feature
requests have been piling up
lately. <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues">80 open issues</a> &ndash;
that&rsquo;s depressing! I guess I&rsquo;m a pretty lame maintainer! :&ndash;)</p>

<p>If you like the project, I&rsquo;d appreciate your assistance to bring their
number down.  Many of the requests are relatively easy to implement,
some don&rsquo;t make sense and should be simply closed (or might have been
fixed accidentally). Same goes for the open PRs.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can support Projectile&rsquo;s continued development via
<a href="https://www.gratipay.com/bbatsov">gratipay</a> or PayPal.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for me now, folks! I&rsquo;ll try to deliver stable releases
faster in the future, but I won&rsquo;t make any promises. Thanks for all
your help and support! I really appreciate them!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I&rsquo;d love for Projectile to have a cool logo. Maybe someone can
help out with that as well?</p>
