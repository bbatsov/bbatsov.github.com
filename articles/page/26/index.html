  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I switched to zsh, after being a bash user for almost 5
years. I was in love with everything in zsh from day one, except one
thing – the default prompt. Although zsh ships with several prompt
themes, I didn’t like any of them so I looked around a little bit and
constructed my own humble prompt. Here it goes:</p>

<p><code>PROMPT='[%n@%m %~]$ '</code></p>

<p>In case you’re wondering what this gibberish means:</p>

<p>%n stands for your username(e.g. bozhidar)</p>

<p>%m stands for the first part of your machine’s hostname(you can use %M
 for the fully qualified name)</p>

<p>%~ stands for the current directory path with your home dir aliased
 with an ‘~’ (if you want to see the path in its natural form use %d
 instead)</p>

<p>All of this strange looking character combinations are called “escape
sequences” and they have special significance to zsh. The rest of the
characters in the prompt definition are represented literally in the
resulting prompt. It looks like this(on my machine):</p>

<p><code>[bozhidar@drow ~/store]$</code></p>

<p>If you like it simply put the prompt definition like in your .zshrc
file. You may want to put a little bit different version of the prompt
in the root user’s .zshrc(if you use root at all that is):</p>

<p><code>PROMPT='[%n@%m %~]# '</code></p>

<p>This follows the well established pattern that a normal shell and a
root shell should be easily distinguished visually.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Updated 29/04/2011</strong></p>

<p>Lately, I’ve started digging more and more into Rails, preparing for
the start of a Rails powered project. Although there are some IDEs
offering decent Rails support(namely RubyMine, NetBeans, Komodo and
Aptana Studio) I have always preferred the comfort of Emacs for
various reasons. So naturally I embarked on a quest to setup a
suitable environment for Rails development in Emacs. After a couple of
days of searching and evaluating possible solutions I finally set up a
worthy environment. It consists of a couple of components –
<a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/ruby-mode.el?view=log">ruby-mode</a>,
<a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/misc/inf-ruby.el?view=log">inf-ruby</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/autopair/">autopair-mode</a>,
<a href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html">nxhtml-mode</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/">yasnippet</a> and
<a href="http://rinari.rubyforge.org/">rinari</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably have guessed by now <em>ruby-mode</em> provides support for
editing ruby source files. The mode is pretty feature complete and
under active development, headed by none other than Matz(Ruby&rsquo;s
creator) himself. I can only assume that Matz is an Emacs user
himself. You can get it from the ruby svn repository if you&rsquo;re using a
version of Emacs older than Emacs 23(it&rsquo;s built-in there).</p>

<p><em>inf-ruby</em> is a mode that spawns and inferior ruby process(irb shell)
to which you can directly send code from the ruby buffer you&rsquo;re
currently editing. For instance &ndash; you can define a function and while
your cursor is inside it you can press C-M-x &ndash; the function definition
will be evaluated in irb automatically and you can test it there. This
is extremely handy!</p>

<p><em>autopair-mode</em> provides auto insertion of closing braces, quotes,
ends, etc. . Instructions how to setup both modes can be found
here. It&rsquo;s a much more generic version of the <em>ruby-electric</em> mode
that used to do similar tasks, but just in Ruby buffers.</p>

<p>Although many people recommend adding pabbrev(a mode which
provides auto-completion) to the setup, I don’t recommend it – I find
the mode mostly annoying and stick to the old school dumb
auto-completion with M-/ . If you&rsquo;re shopping for autocompletion,
however, a much better and smarter choice would be a
RSense[<a href="http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/">http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/</a>].</p>

<p><em>yasnippet</em> is a package that offers dynamically expandable code
snippets(template), quite similar to ones in TextMate. It&rsquo;s very easy
to add your very own snippets if you wish to.</p>

<p><em>nxhtml-mode</em> is a pretty comprehensive package for web development in
general. We need it for its excellent support for erb
templates(.rhtml, .erb.html) and of course xhtml and css. Lately it&rsquo;s
not been as actively developed as it used to be, but it&rsquo;s still a
pretty good mode. Alternatively you can use
<a href="https://github.com/nex3/haml">Haml</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/antonj/scss-mode">SASS</a> and forget about
nxhtml. Both have pretty decent Emacs modes available.</p>

<p><em>rinari</em> is a mode for Rails development – it contains rich
functionality such as the ability to easily navigate between models,
views and controllers in a Rails apfplication amongst other
features. Instructions how to set up rinari together with nxhtml-mode
can be found on rinari’s home page.</p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to add <a href="http://ecb.sourceforge.net/">ecb</a>(the Emacs code browser) to the mix,
though this is entirely optional.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I discussed here are part of the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> that I
develop and maintain. I urge you to use the Emacs Prelude as a starting point to
develop your very own customized version of Emacs. Prelude comes with a
few ruby-mode customizations, yari(ri integration for Emacs), haml and
sass modes, autopair, yaml-mode, yasnippet, css-mode, ecb and a lot of
other goodies(projectile being one of my favourites).</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this setup and it helps boost your Rails productivity in Emacs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every professional developer knows how important to the development
process the keyboard is, so it is only natural to be on the look for
some quality piece of hardware. After a long research in the area of
good keyboards I decided to upgrade my current rig to the recently
released <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">Das Keyboard 3</a>.</p>

<p><img class="mechanical_keyboard.jpg" src="http://www.daskeyboard.com/images/products/mechanical_keyboard.jpg"></p>

<p>Das Keyboard comes in three flavours &ndash; Professional(mechanical
keyboard with labelled keys), Ultimate(the original mechanical
keyboard with blank keys) and Silent(mechanical keyboard with labelled
keys that doesn&rsquo;t produce the trademarked clicking sound of the
original Das Keyboard).</p>

<p>I bought the Ultimate model, of course. I&rsquo;ve been a touch typist for
several years now and I didn&rsquo;t really cared about the labelled
keys(though I did miss them in games). Two words describe this
keyboard perfectly &ndash; <strong>Bad Ass</strong>. It&rsquo;s without a doubt the single
finest piece of keyboard hardware that I&rsquo;ve touched, it&rsquo;s very
comfortable, very solid and I feel that I&rsquo;ve actually improved my
typing speed with it. My colleagues don&rsquo;t like the noisy work of the
keyboard very much, but I have no problems with it. I actually have
grown quite fond of it.</p>

<p>The keyboard also features a two port USB hub, that I didn&rsquo;t really
consider when I was buying it, but it turned out quite helpful. I&rsquo;ve
actually stopped using the USB ports of my computer entirely(except
for input devices) &ndash; I use the keyboard hub to plug-in flash drives
and charge devices. When your computer is sitting beneath a desk you
learn to appreciate USB hubs very quickly.</p>

<p>I have long heard stories about Das Keyboard&rsquo;s quality
and comfort and I it has totally lived up to its hype. They price is
admittedly a bit steep(I bought two keyboards for home and for work
each costing 130$), but this is our hands and productivity we&rsquo;re
talking about so we shouldn&rsquo;t be cheap. So what are
waiting for &ndash; research the market yourselves and make your pick, your
hands deserve a quality keyboard(the Das Keyboard)!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Every Generation Has A Legend. Every Journey Has A First Step. Every<br/>Saga Has A Beginning.</p><footer><strong>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</strong> <cite>Trailer</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post here bits and pieces inspired by my humble experience as a
software developer. Expect to see primarily articles about Lisp,
Emacs, Java and Ruby, but also about software development in general.</p>

<p>As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I often like to quote characters
from the movies. I feel that this is the time for one such quote.</p>

<blockquote><p>Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an<br/>apprentice.</p><footer><strong>Master Yoda</strong> <cite>The Phantom Menace</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I’m no hacker wizard by any means, but I hope that I can
help someone learn something useful and maybe I&rsquo;ll manage to learn something
from the readers of my blog(if I have any, that is). In this sense
one can say that in life we&rsquo;re always the master and the apprentice at
the same time&hellip;</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy reading my blog!</p>
